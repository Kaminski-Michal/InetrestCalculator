array is build 
array[n][0] = month when bond expires
array[n][1] = money stored in that bond
array[n][2] = % of interest
n = number of bond

formula to "buy" new bond = current month + time to expire 

Mistake in checking and adding interest from bonds in date(now it only add interest if bond is about to expire) not every year(or value user gives) when it should 
Need function to resize array after bond expire and add money saved in bonds to balance 
Need function to "buy" new bonds = length + 1 and New array [length+1][0] = month + expire time
